# Rust vs Go

## Objectives

The objective of this repository is to write same programs with both idiomatic Rust and Golang programming language.  
This repository is not an uncovered way for promoting a language against the other one.

## Comparisons and findings

A _README.md_ file can be found in each directory. It describes the behavior of the program and ideally the comparisions of each implementions of the program in Rust and Go.

## This repository is a work in progress

As i have a deeper understanding of Rust than Go, it is possible that the Go programs found here are not yet idiomatics, at least not yet until a better understanding of Go, it's best practice and idioms.
